Today I want to teach you how to find your dream home without losing your mind. It sounds easy enough, but oftentimes we can make it more difficult than it has to be. **Here are some tips to keep in mind to guide you on your search.**

**1. Get pre-approved.** Do this before you even start looking online. We all love to look at these homes and fantasize about them. However, starting your search before you know what your budget is can lead to a lot of frustration. If you need a recommendation for a great local lender, feel free to reach out and we’ll get you connected with someone great.

**2. Know what your must-haves are.** These are non-negotiable items like a certain number of bathrooms, bedrooms, or a specific home feature that you need to have in your new home. Make that list and stick to it. Don’t deviate from an item if it’s a non-negotiable.

**3. Identify your area.** Location is one of the only things you can’t change about your home. You can make improvements, make repairs, and you might even be able to convince your neighbor to trim their trees. However, the location can’t be changed so make sure you like where you’re going to be living before you start looking for homes within the neighborhood.

**4. Limit your viewings.** When you finally get out and about looking for properties, don’t go over five or six viewings in one day. It just won’t lead to a productive search.

**5. Take notes of all the homes you see.** Make note of what you do and don’t like about a home so that you can discuss those important items with your Realtor after your showings.

**6. Stick to your top three.** Once you’ve found the three properties that you love the most, stick to them. Then try and find out how you can position yourself to turn those top three to a top two, and a top one.

**7. Stop looking.** After you’ve found that top three, don’t over-confuse the process by continuing your search. If you’re working with a great Realtor, they’ve already identified all the top properties. 

I hope this information is helpful to you in your home search. If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
