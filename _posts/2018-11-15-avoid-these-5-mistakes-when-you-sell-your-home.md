Here are five things you should definitely avoid when you’re trying to sell your property:

**1. Showing your property by appointment only.** I get it. You live there. You don’t want anybody popping up without fair warning to prepare. However, if a Realtor is busy and doesn’t have time to work around your schedule, they’re going to show a client another similar property where they won’t have as hard of a time. This gives you fewer eyes on your property. Try to come up with an organized schedule of when you can make the property available to show. More eyes mean more offers.

**2. Not taking professional photos.** This is huge in today's market. 93% of buyers view your home online first, so you want it to shine in that space.

**3. Not listing your photos in order.** There should be a carousel-type feel so that buyers feel like they’re walking through the property as they look through the pictures. The order of your photos should be as follows: front of the home, entryway, living room, kitchen, bedrooms, and bathrooms.

**4. Using the term “motivated seller.”**&nbsp;I oftentimes see agents use this phrase when describing a property online. This tells me as an agent that I have a deal for my potential buyer. Seeing the term “motivated seller” attached to a listing means that I can write an offer that’s less than list price. Never allow your agent to put this in the description of your home. That almost guarantees lowball offers.

**5. Pricing your property incorrectly.** This is probably the most important thing of all. Overpricing will take a good 30% to 40% of buyers out of the picture right away. They won’t even give your home a chance. The rest will come and offer you less than your list price anyway. If you price correctly, you will have 80% to 90% of buyers visit your home, giving you the opportunity to show you have a great home and drive the price up where you’d like it to sell. Overpricing always works in the buyer’s favor.

I hope this information helps. If you have any questions for me or if you’re thinking about buying or selling a home any time in the near future, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
